# Breadth-first  

Extending a binary tree and creating a static method that prints a tree's value to the console breadth first.  


# Challenge  

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in
methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.  

# Approach & Efficiency  

Used a queue to keep track of the nodes, storing a node's left and right after dequeueing it from the queue.  

- Space: O(n) 
- Time: O(n)
