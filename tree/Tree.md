# Trees
First assignment regarding the tree data structure

# Challenge  

Create a BinaryTree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder.
Create a BinarySearchTree class and define a method named add that accepts a value,, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree
and define a method named contains that  accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is in the tree at least once.


# Approach & Efficiency  
Time: O(log n) for balanced binary search tree and O(n) for binary tree.  

# API
In this class challenge I used the following methods:	
#### BinaryTree  
- preOrder()  
- inOrder()  
- postOrder()	  

#### BinarySearchTree
