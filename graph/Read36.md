# Breadth First Traversal - Graphs  

Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node that returns a collection of nodes in the order
they were visited. Display the collection.  

# Challenge  

Can't user any built-in methods available to Java  
Graphs don't have a specific order  
Nodes can be neighbors of any other node  
Testing to make sure the returned list of nodes was in the correct order  

# Approach & Efficiency  

After doing some research online it didn't seem that recursion would've provided a simpler method, so I went with iteration  

- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)
