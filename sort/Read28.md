# Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides an array into divisions in a recursive manner based on the outcome of 
sorting the current partition by a pivot point. The array is partitioned and sorted until it is in sorted order throughout.  

# Pseudocode  
```
ALGORITHM QuickSort(arr, left, right)
if left < right
// Partition the array by setting the position of the pivot value
DEFINE position <-- Partition(arr, left, right)
// Sort the left
QuickSort(arr, left, position - 1)
// Sort the right
QuickSort(arr, position + 1, right)

ALGORITHM Partition(arr, left, right)
// set a pivot value as a point of reference
DEFINE pivot <-- arr[right]
// create a variable to track the largest index of numbers lower than the defined pivot
DEFINE low <-- left - 1
for i <- left to right do
if arr[i] <= pivot
low++
Swap(arr, i, low)

     // place the value of the pivot location in the middle.
     // all numbers smaller than the pivot are on the left, larger on the right. 
     Swap(arr, right, low + 1)
    // return the pivot index point
     return low + 1

ALGORITHM Swap(arr, i, low)
DEFINE temp;
temp <-- arr[i]
arr[i] <-- arr[low]
arr[low] <-- temp
```

# Trace  

Sample Array: [8,4,23,42,16,15]  

Pass 1  

To begin, we define the position as the result of a call to partition on the whole array, with the pivot value set to 15.  

Pass 2

Because 8 and 4 are the only numbers smaller than 15, they are "usefully" exchanged.  

Pass 3

The number 15 is replaced with the number 23, resulting in a partition index of two. The section of the array to the left of
the partition (15) is then quicksorted, with 4 as the pivot value. There are no swaps since 8 is not smaller than 4. The number
4 is replaced with the number 8, resulting in a partition index of 0.  

Pass 4  

Then, using 0 as the left value and -1 as the right value, we call quicksort. Nothing is done since 0 is not less than left (0).  

Pass 5  

Then, with 1 as the left and right values, we call quicksort. Nothing is done since 1 is not smaller than 1.  

Pass 6

The section of the array to the right of the partition (15) is then quicksorted, with 23 as the pivot value. There is no swap
because 42 is more than 23. Because 16 is less than 23, it is replaced with the low index of 3. The partition index of 4 is
defined by swapping 23 with 42. Then, using 3 as the left and right values, we call quicksort. Nothing is done since 3 is not
less than 3. Then, with 5 as the left and right values, we call quicksort. Nothing is done because 5 is not less than  
We've completed the right half of 15!  

Pass 7  

Sorted Array: [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
